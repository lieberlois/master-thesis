	abstract = {IoT edge computing is a new computing paradigm “in the IoT domain” for performing calculations and processing at the edge of the network, closer to the user and the source of the data. This paradigm is relatively recent, and, together with cloud and fog computing, there may be some confusion about its meaning and implications. This paper aims to help practitioners and researchers better understand what the industry thinks about what IoT edge computing is, and the expected benefits and challenges associated with this paradigm. We conducted a survey using a semi-structured in-depth questionnaire to collect qualitative data from relevant stakeholders from 29 multinational companies and qualitatively analyzed these data using the Constructivist Grounded Theory (Charmaz) method. Several researchers participated in the coding process (collaborative coding). To ensure consensus on the constructs that support the theory and thus improve the rigor of qualitative research, we conducted an intercoder agreement analysis. From the analysis, we have derived a substantive and analytic theory of what companies perceive about IoT edge computing, its benefits and challenges. The theory is substantive in that the scope of validity refers to the 29 surveys processed and analytic in that it analyzes “what is” rather than explaining causality or attempting predictive generalizations. A public repository with all the data related to the information capture process and the products resulting from the analysis of this information is publicly available. This study aims to strengthen the evidence and support practitioners in making better informed decisions about why companies are adopting edge computing and the current challenges they face. Additionally, the testing theory phase shows that the results are aligned with the ISO/IEC TR 30164 standard.},

	abstract = {Edge computing (EC) is a recent computing paradigm in the IoT domain for performing calculations and processing at the edge of the network, closer to the user instead of moving all data to the cloud. In this way, EC practitioners aim to replicate the benefits of cloud computing but closer to the source of the data, reducing the latency imposed by the distance between the cloud and the end devices, the network overhead, and the security and privacy risk that this offloading entails. But not only that. EC practitioners also aim to replicate best practices used on cloud-native development and operation. In this regard, GitOps is one of the main trends in the DevOps ecosystem for Continuous Deployment (CD) that promotes infrastructure automation in highly distributed applications, accelerating value delivery while avoiding error-prone manual processes. Till now, GitOps has been mainly related to Kubernetes—a widely used container orchestration platform to run distributed applications resiliently. In this regard, more and more IoT EC solutions are implementing container orchestration solutions like Kubernetes, thus, it is worthwhile identifying the benefits that GitOps adoption could leverage at the Edge and how possible challenges and drawbacks could be addressed. This paper presents a proof of concept based on tools included in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) landscape to check the feasibility of applying GtiOps in IoT EC solutions. Several drawbacks were detected mainly due to the used tooling, such as lack of automatic provisioning of physical infrastructure, tight coupled to Kubernetes descriptors for declaring workloads, and limitations on the edge devices that can be supported.},

	abstract = {Edge computing is a viable approach to improve service delivery and performance parameters by extending the cloud with resources placed closer to a given service environment. Numerous research papers in the literature have already identified the key benefits of this architectural approach. However, most results are based on simulations performed in closed network environments. This paper aims to analyze the existing implementations of processing environments containing edge resources, taking into account the targeted quality of service (QoS) parameters and the utilized orchestration platforms. Based on this analysis, the most popular edge orchestration platforms are evaluated in terms of their workflow that allows the inclusion of remote devices in the processing environment and their ability to adapt the logic of the scheduling algorithms to improve the targeted QoS attributes. The experimental results compare the performance of the platforms and show the current state of their readiness for edge computing in real network and execution environments. These findings suggest that Kubernetes and its distributions have the potential to provide effective scheduling across the resources on the network’s edge. However, some challenges still have to be addressed to completely adapt these tools for such a dynamic and distributed execution environment as edge computing implies.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the concept of Industry 4.0 aims to improve factories’ competitiveness. Usually, manufacturing production is guided by standards to segment and distribute its processes and implementations. However, industry 4.0 requires innovative proposals for disruptive technologies that engage the entire production process in factories, not just a partial improvement. One of these disruptive technologies is the Digital Twin (DT). This advanced virtual model runs in real-time and can predict, detect, and classify normal and abnormal operating conditions in factory processes. The Automation Pyramid (AP) is a conceptual element that enables the efﬁcient distribution and connection of different actuators in enterprises, from the shop ﬂoor to the decision-making levels. When a DT is deployed into a manufacturing system, generally, the DT focuses on the low-level that is named ﬁeld level, which includes the physical devices such as controllers, sensors, and so on. Thus, the partial automation based on the DT is accomplished, and the information between all manufacturing stages could be decremented. Hence, to achieve a complete improvement of the manufacturing system, all the automation pyramid levels must be included in the DT concept. An artiﬁcial intelligent management system could create an interconnection between them that can manage the information. As a result, this paper proposed a complete DT structure covering all automation pyramid stages using Artiﬁcial Intelligence (AI) to model each stage of the AP based on the Digital Twin concept. This work proposes a virtual model for each level of the traditional AP and the interactions among them to ﬂow and control information efﬁciently. Therefore, the proposed model is a valuable tool in improving all levels of an industrial process. In addition, It is presented a case study where the DT concept for modular workstations underpins the development of technologies within the framework of the Automation Pyramid model is implemented into a didactic manufacturing system.},
