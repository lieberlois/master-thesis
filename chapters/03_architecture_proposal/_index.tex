\chapter{Architecture Proposal}
\label{chapter:architecture-proposal}

In this chapter we will discuss the recommended reference architecture for hybrid cloud industrial IoT systems designed by the company MaibornWolff GmbH. We will first explore the structure of the architecture followed by an in-depth exploration of essential topics that are necessary to be able to apply the architecture in a real world project. Apart from other sources, this chapter will follow the ``Building IIoT 2023'' conference presentation \cite{building_iiot} by Sebastian Wöhrl and Marc Jäckle (MaibornWolff GmbH).
